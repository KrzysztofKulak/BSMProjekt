A project for the Mobile Systems Safety class on the university.
It's the Android app that safely stores confident note with a password based encryption.

### Known issue:
IV generation should occur every encoding, not just with the password change. It's not very unsafe, but I'll fix it when I'll have some time to open the Android Studio.
